As MSc student at the University of Amsterdam, I conducted my MSc Research Project in the JetSet research group of Prof. Dr. Sera Markoff from September 2023 until August 2024. During my time in the JetSet group, I wrote three blog posts on Sera's website. This third post is essentially a reflection on my amazing one-month stay with [the theoretical high-energy astrohysics research group](https://www.ntnu.edu/physics/research/theoretical/astrophys) led by Dr. Foteini Oikonomou at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim (Norway). This was possible because I was the proud winner of *the Volkert van der Willigen grant* for MSc students.
