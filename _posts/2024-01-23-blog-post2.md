As MSc student at the University of Amsterdam, I conducted my MSc Research Project in the JetSet research group of Prof. Dr. Sera Markoff from September 2023 until August 2024. During my time in the JetSet group, I wrote three blog posts on Sera's website. During this year, I volunteered for the Altair project which is an academic outreach program to teach astronomy, science and what it is like to science at a local primary school organized by the University of Amsterdam. The key message of the lessons was that science is not about being extremely smart; it is about being curious about the world around you.

Volunteering for this project led me to reflect on the project itself, but also on the Dutch school system in which I grew up. In this second part of this blog series, I discuss the Dutch school system and its strengths and weaknesses regarding motivating students to go into science.
