As MSc student at the University of Amsterdam, I conducted my MSc Research Project in the JetSet research group of Prof. Dr. Sera Markoff from September 2023 until August 2024. During my time in the JetSet group, I wrote three blog posts on Sera's website. During this year, I volunteered for the Altair project which is an academic outreach program to teach astronomy, science and what it is like to science at a local primary school organized by the University of Amsterdam. The key message of the lessons was that science is not about being extremely smart; it is about being curious about the world around you.

Volunteering for this project led me to reflect on the project itself, but also on the Dutch school system in which I grew up. This first part is mostly concerned with the description of the Altair project and how important it is that scientists take on this role of communicating their science to the general public. In [the second part](https://scottv19.github.io/posts/2024/01/blog-post-2/) of this blog series, I discuss the Dutch school system and its strengths and weaknesses regarding motivating students to go into science.
