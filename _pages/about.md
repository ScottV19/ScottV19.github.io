Hello and welcome on my personal webpage. My name is Scott Visser and I am a PhD candidate at the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, working in the LOFAR radio astronomy group. My research is focused on how supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies evolve through time and how they can influence their surroundings such as their host galaxy. Nowadays, using the amazing LOFAR radio telescope and the new Euclid optical/infrared telescope, among other telescopes, we can observe millions of stars and galaxies in across the entire sky. I am interested in combining the data of these two telescopes to find how galaxies and the black holes at their center evolve and interact from a statistical point of view using the numerous galaxies that can be found in these enormous datasets.

In addition to doing research, I have a passion for teaching and academic outreach to let the world know what amazing developments there are in science and astronomy specifically. I have taught astronomy at primary and high schools in the Netherlands and I also participated in multiple outreach programs to get young children interested in science.

Feel free to browse around this webpage and I am happy to connect if you have questions, comments or if just want to talk.
