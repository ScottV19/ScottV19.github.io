excerpt: 'The recent detection of astrophysical neutrinos temporally coincident with γ-ray flares from blazars has led to an increased interest in these sources. Blazars are supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies with a relativistic jet of matter closely aligned with our line of sight. These jets, which can extend to the size of entire galaxies and move at nearly the speed of light, produce non-thermal radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum through synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The alignment of blazars jets leads to a significant enhancement of the observed flux due to relativistic beaming such that they can outshine entire galaxies by a million times. While blazars themselves are interesting objects to study, the simultaneous observation of γ-ray flares and neutrinos suggests an intimate connection between blazars and the astrophysical backgrounds of γ-rays, neutrinos and cosmic rays. This link implies that blazars might be the source of these astrophysical backgrounds whose origin is unknown. To produce these backgrounds, the relativistic jet in blazars need to accelerate not only electrons, but also protons and heavier nuclei, leading to hadronic interactions in which γ-rays and neutrinos can be produced. The accelerated hadrons will then stream through the Universe providing the cosmic ray background. Generally, the multi-wavelength emission produced by blazar jets is crucial for studying the physical conditions, the emitting particle distribution and the acceleration mechanisms within these jets. In order to explain their multi-wavelength emission, different approaches exist- from simpler single-zone to more complex multi-zone geometries, and from purely leptonic to incorporating lepto-hadronic interactions—there is no consensus on the best method. Advances in computing power now allow for the development of detailed multi-zone geometries, but this requires a good understanding of the different approaches. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of single- and multi-zone black hole jet models by fitting the multi-wavelength emission of blazars TXS 0506+056 and PKS 1424-418. Our results show that tracking the entire evolution of the jet yields statistically better fits and offer deeper insights into the launching, evolution, and particle acceleration processes of the jet. Including the hadronic interactions of protons allows to lift degeneracies present in while preserving the overall jet conditions. The same behavior was seen for the single-zone geometry, where lepto-hadronic fits were better constrained and showed no degeneracies. While blazars are extreme astrophysical objects, this study showed that multi-zone models can explain these objects while requiring less extreme conditions and provide more accurate fits.'
