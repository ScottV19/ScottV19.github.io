excerpt: 'The space in between the stars is flled with interstellar dust of which the physical and chemical properties are still not well understood. X-rays provide a powerful tool to probe the composition of this interstellar dust by measuring the radiation that it transmits. In order to understand the spectral signatures of interstellar dust we need to obtain reliable models using laboratory data. In this thesis we obtained transmission data for the iron L-edges for a set of interstellar dust analogues using EELS. Our analysis resulted in extinction, scattering and absorption cross sections for all dust analogues based on the MRN grain size distribution. We also looked at the effect of incorporating larger dust grains on the extinction cross sections and found that the cross sections show no new spectral features and that they have a stronger scattering component. Lastly, we show a simulated astrophysical spectrum of the future Athena mission, which will have superior capabilities with respect to present intruments. We can conclude that we found extinction models for interstellar dust around the iron L-edges with a resolution and signal-tonoise ratio that are suffcient to compare present and future astronomical data. These can help to fit future astronomical data and deepen our understanding of the properties of interstellar dust.'
